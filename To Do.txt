To add:

1)  Menu to choose MIDI Out
	-   add to left sidebar
	-   clickable button
	-   show list of possible midi devices

2)  Menu to choose Controller input
    -   same area as MIDI out selection

3)  Velocity changes via right shoulder buttons
    -   when select button held down, user can modify velocities via shoulder axis buttons
    -   left shoulder sets vel of first step, right shoulder sets last step, with vals inbetween interpolated?
    -   or could do it so that this defines a random range, with the l and r as upper and lower bounds

4)  fix master components
	-   store as array
	-   use dict to map the array elements to single letters
	    (use one colour for each component, so multiple components can have the same single letter)
	-   do we just make it so that master components affect all tracks? can potentially
	    change this later

5)  fix zoom edit on the master track - has no attr 'notes'

6)  add scales - probably some scale files we can get from Reaper - option to force notes to scale,
    or evaluate during playback?

7)  add menu navigation and bindings for LPB, length, swing,  scale, BPM and loops
    - use radial menus

8)  add track outline colouring for selected tracks

9)  pressing some modifier key shows which 'page' the cursor is currently on and allows users to switch
    page - pages can be master track, pattern tracks, phrase, song: or, if we know there will only be
    these four pages, we can map each one to a single button while the modifier is pressed



    for full page menus we can repurpose the tracker pattern page, have say 8 x 16 options;
    could work for save and load

10) note seek broken with new list note structure

11) duplicate broken - referencing note rather than notes
